### Algorithim for decomposing a square matrix into its Upper and Lower Triangluar components

In Linear Algebra, decomposing a **square** (nxn) matrix into its *lower triangular* and *upper triangluar* components is a very useful step for determining the inverse and determinant, for solving systems of equations, and applying the Wronskian method to test for linear independence. This method is essentially a modified version of Gaussian Elimination, and is used by most computers to solve systems of equations. Shortcut to my code can be found [here](https://github.com/bztighe/MATLAB_algorithims/blob/master/LU%20decomposition/luFactor.m).
